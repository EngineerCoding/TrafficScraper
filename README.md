# Trafic Scraper

A small project to collect data about the dutch traffic jams. This mostly is a project for me to learn C#, but the plan is to actually run this in a cron job to collect the data over a few days. Along with self-collected data about me travelling efficiently to and from work, I might be able to eventually apply some machine learning to figure out what the optimal time is for me to leave from home and work.

This latter part, may never happen though.

Feel free to comment on my code and make PR's to improve it!
